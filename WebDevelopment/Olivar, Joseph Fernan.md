### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- As far as I remember, its either friendster or battleon, latter still exists surprisingly (but was mitigated to a game engine due to flash), but it still look as it was before, maybe a just new stuffs but I cant tell if there is a big change.

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- I have no specific website in mind, but I would like to make something that would help someone explore this whole field in maybe one narative or program.

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- Hmmm

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- None so far.
