### If you can recall, what was the first website you've ever visited? Does it still exist? If so, how did it look back then? Has it changed nowadays?
- `Probably y8.com or some other flash games website. Surprisingly, it still exists and looks about the same with small changes, although I expect a lot of games on the site will not work because of the discontinuation of Adobe Flash.`

### Describe the website you want to build someday
- `A website where you can list tasks you want done, such as watch a movie at a theater or a chore, and other people can accept tasks to do with you or for you.`

### So far, do you have any companies that you are aspiring to work for? Why?
- `One of FAANG maybe since those are like the biggest tech companies.`

### Anything you want the team to discuss in the future?
- `Next.js and serverless databases`
